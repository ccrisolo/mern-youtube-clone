/* 
Salt rounds, also referred to as the cost factor or work factor, determine the computational complexity of the hashing process. Essentially, the higher the number of salt rounds, the longer it takes to hash a password.
Bcrypt uses a two-step process for password hashing:
It generates a salt (a random string) and appends it to the password.
It applies the hashing algorithm a number of times (this number is determined by the salt rounds).
Salt Rounds Impact:
Lower salt rounds (e.g., 4): Faster hashing, but less secure since itâ€™s easier to crack.
Higher salt rounds (e.g., 12 or more): Slower hashing, but significantly more secure because it takes longer for an attacker to attempt brute force attacks.
By increasing the salt rounds, bcrypt adapts to increasing processing power, making it harder for attackers to brute-force passwords. A typical recommended number of salt rounds is 10 to 12 for modern systems.
